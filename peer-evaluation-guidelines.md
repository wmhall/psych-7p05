# Guidelines for peer review of assignments:

As part of this course, you will review and comment on other students' homework assignments. This is a mandatory part of the course, and you will be marked on your peer reviews.

Your peer review will be shared with the person you were assigned.

## How to do peer review well:

-   Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments.
-   Be specific and concise.
-   Use [general homework rubric](general-rubric.md) to for ideas about criteria to evaluate and comment on
-   Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.
-   If you can't find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.

## How you will be marked:

-   Each peer review will be marked on the following scale:
    -   0 = not constructive/mean
    -   1 = needs more
    -   2 = great
-   Hallmarks of the “not constructive/mean” feedback:
    -   Your review is mean
    -   There is no evidence that you tried to engage with the person's code.
-   Hallmarks of “needs more” feedback:
    -   Your review is so generic that it could be applied to anyone
    -   Your review is overly negative.
    -   You can’t find anything to praise/learn and you don’t offer any suggestions either.

## Writing and submitting your peer review:

You will find your classmates' homework posted on the BrightSpace discussion forum called Homework Peer Review. This is the same place where you posted your homework submission. Note that your classmates' posts will only be visible to you after the homework submission deadline.

For each homework, you have been assigned to review two of your classmates' work. The peer review assignments can be found on BrightSpace.

For each peer review, create an R project (e.g., `peer-review-hw01-01.Rproj`).

Use Quarto to write your peer reviews. Using Quarto will allow you to easily reference code snippets. E.g.,

> It was awesome when you did this. It helped me learn about X.

```         
#cool code here
```

Using the `eval: false` option in Quarto will be helpful. It allows you to paste snippets of code into your peer review without worrying about whether they work as standalone pieces of code.

Once you have finished your peer review, create a zip file of your R project folders. Create one zip file for each peer review. This means you should have two zip files to upload. The zip file is what you will upload to the BrightSpace forums. See these instructions for how to create a zip file:

To attach your Zip files to a post on the BrightSpace forums, follow the instructions [here](https://community.d2l.com/brightspace/kb/articles/18063-communicate-with-others-using-discussions#attach-a-file-to-a-discussion-thread).

You should post your peer review as a post in response to your classmates' homework.

Peer reviewing and critiquing others' work is a valuable skill to develop during your graduate studies. Although these links deal mainly with the peer review of academic papers, most of the key points are applicable to our peer review process.

Code walk-through,Coding style,1 point,"Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable"
Code walk-through,Coding style,2 points,"Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments"
Code walk-through,Coding style,3 points,"Beyond what was expected and required, style guide is followed, code is well commented"
Code walk-through,Coding strategy,1 point,Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be made more efficient.
Code walk-through,Coding strategy,2 points,"Code is works, but could be edited down to leaner code."
Code walk-through,Coding strategy,3 points,Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient and minimal.
Code walk-through,Output,1 point,Output poorly chosen to support write-up.
Code walk-through,Output,2 points,"Output well chosen, but with a few minor problems (see examples below)."
Code walk-through,Output,3 points,Output carefully tuned for desired purpose (see exapmles below).
Introduction,Introduction,0 points,The chosen problem/package was not introduced.
Introduction,Introduction,1 point,The description of the problem/package was very difficult to understand.
Introduction,Introduction,2 points,The chosen problem/package was introduced but some elements were unclear.
Introduction,Introduction,3 points,The chosen package/problem was described in an immediately interesting and clear way.
Conclusions,Conclusions,0 points,No effort was made to reflect on and describe what was learned.
Conclusions,Conclusions,1 point,Minimal effort was made to reflect on and describe what was learned.
Conclusions,Conclusions,2 points,There was  evidence of reflection on what was learned.
Conclusions,Conclusions,3 points,"It was clear that considerable effort was to made to reflect on what was learned, and this was skillfully communicated."

Overall style,"Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity",0 points,A failure to show any mastery of R. The chosen task was too limited in scope.
Overall style,"Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity",1 point,R not used with expected level of mastery. The chosen task was too limited in scope.
Overall style,"Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity",2 points,"R is used very competently and, perhaps, somewhat creatively. The chosen task was acceptable but fairly conservative in ambition."
Overall style,"Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity",3 points,"Beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated use of R."
Overall style,Communication,0 points,No evidence of efforts to organize and effectively communicate chosen topic.
Overall style,Communication,1 point,The write-up had several organizational issues; It was difficult to understand; Supporting code/table/figures were not well prepared
Overall style,Communication,2 points,"The write-up is for the most part clearly and logically organized (intro, body, conclusion); Supporting code/table/figures were well prepared but could have been clearer in a few places."
Overall style,Communication,3 points,"The write-up had a clear and logical organization (intro, body, conclusion); Supporting code/table/figures were well prepared, informative, effective, and not distracting."
Ease of access,Ease of access,0 points,Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run
Ease of access,Ease of access,1 point,Satisfactory
Ease of access,Ease of access,2 points,Access as easy as possible; code runs!

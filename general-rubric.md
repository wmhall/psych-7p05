| Coding strategy                                                                      | Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be made more efficient.                                                                                                                                          | Code is works, but could be edited down to leaner code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient and minimal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Communication                                                                        | Very little earnest effort to clearly communicate ideas. E.g., graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions; table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places; table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings; other major display problems. | Satisfactory effort to clearly communicate ideas. E.g., graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels; table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies; appropriate use of prose to describe process | Student has gone beyond what was expected and required. E.g., graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose; one graph illustrates one point; table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons; careful styling highlights important ideas; prose skillfully used to enrich understanding of students' process |
| Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity                                         | Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.                                                                                                                | Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps, somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable but fairly conservative in ambition.                                                                                                                | Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run                                                                                                                                                           | Satisfactory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Access as easy as possible; code runs!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

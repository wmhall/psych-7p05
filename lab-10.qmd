### Fit a linear model

Using the `gapminder` dataset, fit a linear model (`lm`) in which you predict `lifeExp` from `year`.

Once you've fit your model, explore the various tidiers from the `broom` package. You should be able to explain how `tidy()`, `glance()`, and `augment()` differ from one another in the types of things they tell you about your model.

### Fit models to subsets of the data

```{r}
#| echo: false
tibble::tribble(
                                        ~group_a,    ~group_b,
                                          "Iraq",   "Morocco",
                                        "Zambia", "Indonesia",
                                       "Namibia",    "Sweden",
                                      "Zimbabwe",   "Ecuador",
                      "Central African Republic",    "Brazil"
                      ) |> 
	knitr::kable()
```

Pick two countries from `group_a` and two from `group_b`, and for each country, fit a linear model predicting `lifeExp` from `year`.

Tidy the model outputs using functions from `broom`. Use your `dplyr` skills to sort through the parameter estimates. `filter()` and `arrange()` will be helpful here. You should be able to do things like filter for different parameter estimates (I.e., Intercept vs. Year).

Can you create a useful plot of the parameter estimates for the relationship between `lifeExp` from `year` for the different countries? To do this, you might need to explore the `bind_rows()` function.

### Explore the models

#### Find poorly fitting models

For the four countries that you selected, identify poorly fitting models by looking at the various fit statistics you can extract with the `broom` package.

Visualize the data associated with the four countries you selected so that you can see when a linear model might not be appropriate.

Here is an idea of how you might do that. I'm using a line plot to show the differences in the data from countries in `group_a` vs `group_b`. Can you make something similar?

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("line-plot.png")
```

#### Exploring residuals

Compare the model residuals (extracted via `augment()`) for countries from `group_a` vs `group_b`. What do you find? Is there a plot you can create to show the differences?

In the plot below, I visualize the residuals from two countries from `group_a` and two from `group_b` (the same countries from the plot above). Look at how the residuals balloon in the models that struggle to account for the underlying data. Can you make something similar?

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("residual-plot.png")
```

### I want to do more!

-   Make APA style tables for the models that you fit in this lab.
-   After making your tables, try outputting them to word document.
-   Use [inline code](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto#inline-code) to write up the results from one of your regression models 
-   Try fitting a different type of model (e.g, `cor()`, `aov()`, `glm()`, etc.) using one of the built in dataset in R. For a list of the built in datasets, type `data()` in your R Console.

### Fit a linear model

Using the `gapminder` dataset, fit a linear model (`lm`) in which you predict `lifeExp` from `year`. 

Once you've fit your model, explore the various tidiers from the `broom` package. You should be able to explain how  `tidy()`, `glance()`, and `augment()` differ from one another in the types of things they tell you about your model.  

### Fit many linear models

Using the approach I described in the lecture, fit a linear model predicting `lifeExp` from `year` for each country in the `gapminder` dataset.

Tidy the model outputs using functions from `broom`. Use your `dplyr` skills to sort through the parameter estimates. `filter()` and `arrange()` will be helpful here. You should be able to do things like find countries where there is a non-significant relationship between `year` and `lifeExp`.

Can you create a useful plot of the parameter estimates? This might be challenging if you try and do it for every country so maybe select a subset and then visualize using `ggplot`. 

### Explore the models

#### Find poorly fitting models

Identify poorly fitting models by looking at the various fit statistics you can extract with the `broom` package. 

For example, here are the fit statistic for the first 10 countries when you fit a linear model predicting `lifeExp` from `year`. Can you produce something similar and then use your `dplyr` skills to isolate the poorly fitting models (e.g., a low R-squared).  

```{r}
#| echo: false
read_rds(here::here("rsq.rds")) %>% 
  select(-data, -fm, -tidy_fit_obs, -tidied) %>% 
  head(10) 
```

Once you've found a few poorly fitting models, visualize the data associated with those countries so that you can see why a linear model might not be appropriate. 

Here is an idea of how you might do that. I'm using a line plot to show the differences in the data from countries with high vs low R-squared. Can you make something similar?

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("line-plot.png")
```

#### Exploring residuals

Compare the residuals (extracted via `augment()`) for models with a high R-squared vs a low R-squared. What do you find? Is there a plot you can create to show the differences?

In the plot below, I visualize the residuals from 5 countries (the same countries from the plot above) where the R-squared is high (vs. low). Look at how the residuals balloon in the models that struggle to account for the underlying data. Can you make something similar? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("residual-plot.png")
```

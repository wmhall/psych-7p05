### Overview

Goals:

- Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate
  the effect in data and in figures.
- Write a figure to file explicitly and include it in your Quarto report
  via `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)` or `knitr::include_graphics()`.

Remember the [sampler
concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(needlework)). Your
homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for
canonical tasks. Make things nice – your future self will thank you!

#### Gapminder data

Work with the `gapminder` data for this homework.

### Factor management

**Drop Oceania.** Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations
associated with the `continent` of Oceania. Additionally, use
`fct_drop()` to remove unused factor levels.

Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing
Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected
factors.

**Reorder the levels of `country` or `continent`.** Use `fct_reorder()`
to change the order of the factor levels, based on a summary statistic
of one of the quantitative variables or another derived quantity, such
as estimated intercept or slope. If you use a summary of, e.g., life
expectancy, try something besides the default of `median()`.

Show us the data before and after your factor re-ordering (you can use
the `levels()` function to do this.).

- Explore the effects of `arrange()`. Does merely arranging the data
  have any effect on, say, a figure?
- Explore the effects of `fct_reorder()` and `fct_reorder()` +
  `arrange()`. What effect does this have on a figure?
- These explorations should involve the data, the factor levels, and
  some figures.

### Writing figures to file

Use `ggsave()` to explicitly write a figure to file. Things to play
around with:

- Arguments of `ggsave()`, such as width, height, resolution or text
  scaling.
- Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format.

Embed the figure in your report. To learn more about embedding figures,
take a look at the [Quarto
Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html).

### But I want to do more!

- Pick a handful of countries and create an excerpt of the Gapminder
  data, filtered to just these countries. Recode (e.g., `case_when()`,
  `left_join`, `fct_recode`, or something else) the country variable
  into a new factor variable that houses some new fact about each
  country.

        * Example: Italy --> Euro, Japan --> Yen, Mexico --> Peso. Let your creativity flourish.

Take control of the ordering of your new factor with `fct_relevel()`.
Confirm the new ordering with `levels()`.

- Experiment with gluing two factors together. First, try using the
  trusty `c()`. Next, try `fct_c()`. Then try it again when those
  factors are embedded in two data frames - to do this you’ll need to
  use `bind_rows()`. Explain the nuances and gotchas of the different
  approaches.

When comparing the different approaches, consider these questions: What
if the factors you are combining have the same levels? Different levels?

E.g.,

``` r
f1 <- factor(c("yes", "no"), levels = c("yes", "no"))
f2 <- factor(c("yes", "no"), levels = c("no", "yes"))
```

### Report your process

You’re encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved,
helpful tutorials you read, etc. Give credit to your sources, whether
it’s a blog post, a fellow student, an online tutorial, etc.

### Rubric

Check minus: One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed
opportunities to complement code and numbers with a figure and
interpretation. Technical problem that is relatively easy to fix.

Check: Hits all the elements. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No
heroic detective work required. Well done!

Check plus: Exceeded the requirements in number of dimensions. Developed
novel tasks that were indeed interesting and “worked”. Impressive use of
R – maybe involving functions, packages or workflows that weren’t given
in class materials. Impeccable organization of report. You learned
something new from reviewing their work and you’re eager to incorporate
it into your work.

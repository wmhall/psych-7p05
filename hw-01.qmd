### Overview

In this homework you are going to explore the `gapminder` data. You will learn to establish workflows based on `data.frame`. You will also learn how to author a dynamic report in Quarto.

Remember the [sampler concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(needlework)). Your homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for things to do with a new dataset. Give yourself the cheatsheet you deserve!

#### Bring rectangular data in

Work with the `gapminder` data we explored in class. 

Start by loading the `gapminder` package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(gapminder)

```

#### Get to know your the data

Explore the `gapminder` object:

  * Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list, or something else?
  * What's its mode, class? There are functions to help you figure this out. 
  * How many variables/columns?
  * How many rows/observations?
  * Can you get these facts about "extent" or "size" in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts?
  * What flavor is each variable?
  
#### Explore individual variables

Pick __at least__ one categorical variable and at least one quantitative variable to explore.

  * Characterize what's possible, i.e. all possible values or max vs. min ... whatever's appropriate.
  * What's typical? What's the spread? What's the distribution? Etc., tailored to the variable at hand.
  * Feel free to use summary stats, tables, figures. We're NOT expecting high production value (yet).
  
To answer these questions, you might have to do some detective work and learn a few new functions.
  
#### But I want to do more!

*This is just for people who want to take things further! NOT REQUIRED!*

##### Explore various plot types

Explore base R plots [The Base Plotting System in R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html)

In this course, we will be using `ggplot2` for data visualization. If you want to get a head start on that material, see the [`ggplot2` chapters from r4ds](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/visualize) for ideas, and add a few plots to your homework. 


##### Do more statistical summarization

Do more statistical summarization and visual exploration. For example, start to look at the relationships between variables.

Read [What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2014-06-13-what-i-do-when-i-get-a-new-data-set-as-told-through-tweets/) from [SimplyStatistics](http://simplystatistics.org) to get some ideas!
  
### Report your process

You're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.

### Submit the assignment

Follow instructions on [How to submit homework](general-rubric.md).

### Rubric

Our [general rubric](general-rubric.md) applies, but also ...

Check minus: Hits the elements listed above in a really minimal or rote way, maybe even with a few mistakes/omissions. And/or it's hard to figure out which file we are even supposed to be looking at.

Check: Hits all the elements. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No heroic detective work required. Solid.

Check plus: Some "above and beyond", creativity, etc. We learned something new from reviewing your work and we're eager to incorporate it into our work now.

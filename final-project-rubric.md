| Coding strategy | Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be made more efficient. | Code is works, but could be edited down to leaner code.                                       | Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient and minimal. |
| Output          | Output poorly chosen to support write-up.                                                                      | Output well chosen, but with a few minor problems (see examples below).                       | Output carefully tuned for desired purpose (see exapmles below).                                                     |

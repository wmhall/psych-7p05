| Topic                                                                                | Check plus                                                                                                                                                                                   | Check                                                                                                                                                                | Check mimus                                                                                                                              |

| Coding style                                                                         | Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, style guide is followed, code is well commented                                                                                      | Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments                                                                        | Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable                                                     |
| Coding strategy                                                                      | Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient and minimal.                                                                         | Code is works, but could be edited down to leaner code.                                                                                                              | Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be made more efficient.                           |
| Graphs                                                                               | Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point                                                                                                                | Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels.                                                                       | Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions.                                                                                             |
| Tables                                                                               | Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features.                                                              | Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.                                                                                      | Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.    |
| Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity                                         | Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course. | Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps, somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable but fairly conservative in ambition. | Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope. |
| Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work | Access as easy as possible; code runs!                                                                                                                                                       | Satisfactory                                                                                                                                                         | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run                                            |
